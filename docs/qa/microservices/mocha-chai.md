## Mocha/Chai

Mocha is a flexible JavaScript test framework, and Chai is an assertion library that integrates seamlessly with Mocha. Together, they provide a powerful combination for testing JavaScript applications, including both front-end and back-end code.

BDD and TDD: Mocha supports both Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD) testing styles, allowing you to choose the most suitable approach for your project.

Customization: Mocha is highly customizable, allowing you to use different assertion libraries (like Chai) and reporter plugins to tailor your test setup.

Back-End Testing: Mocha is often used for testing server-side code, making it a versatile choice for full-stack JavaScript applications.
